            <h2>Step 1 - Run a default nginx docker container</h2>
            <h3>Run nginx </h3>
            <code>docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:latest</code>
            <h4>Explanation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-d </b>means detached, this is optional but it makes it so the container doesn't block the
                    terminal.</li>
                <li><b>-p 80:80 </b>mean that the ports will be bound to 80 on your machine to 80 inside the docker
                    container</li>
                <li><b>nginx:latest</b> is the latest nginx server that dockerhub has. You can replace latest with any
                    version of the software you want to run that is in the hub.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Test it Out</h3>
            <p>Open your browser and go to localhost:80. You should see the default nginx website being hosted on your
                machine.</p>
        </section>
        <section aria-label="Step 2">
            <h2>Step 2 - Host this website in Docker</h2>
            <h3>Stop the previous docker container by using the Docker Desktop App.</h3>
            <img src="images/DockerImageStop.png" alt="Locate the image and press the stop button.">
            <h3>Create your Dockerfile</h3>
            <p>Create a new file at the root folder at the same level as the Readme.md file. Call it Dockerfile. You
                should see a blue whale appear next to it.</p>
            <h3>Add your build code</h3>
            <code>
                FROM nginx:latest<br />
                COPY ./tutorial /usr/share/nginx/html
            </code>
            <h4>Explanation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>FROM</b> needs to be in all caps and lets docker know which base image to use.</li>
                <li><b>COPY</b> also needs to be in all caps. It will copy our html content into the linux server at the
                    directory where nginx looks for the web page to serve.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Create a Build</h3>
            <code>docker build -t dockerTutorial:1.0 .</code>
            <h4>Explanation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>-t</b> means the tag you want to give it. The tag of the server we used before without your code
                    was nginx.</li>
                <li><b>:1.0</b> is your versioning number. You can change this number as your version of the page
                    advances while keeping your old images available to view later on.</li>
                <li><b>.</b> the dot is important. It means tho use this folder to get the build instructions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Run Your Build</h3>
            <code>docker run -d -p 80:80 dockerTutorial:1.0</code>
            <p>Note that this is the same run command from before but we are now running the dockerTutorial instead of
                the default nginx.</p>
            <h3>Test it Out</h3>
            <p>Reload your localhost:80 page. Tada! You should see this tutorial running on an nginx server in a docker
                container.</p>
